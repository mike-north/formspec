## 0.1.0-alpha.4

### Patch Changes

- [#18](https://github.com/mike-north/formspec/pull/18) [`2ccf6d1`](https://github.com/mike-north/formspec/commit/2ccf6d1174f3e08f95822f0c7cb14c0ff66d569b) Thanks [@mike-north](https://github.com/mike-north)! - Add README.md documentation to all npm packages
  - Added comprehensive README.md files to formspec, @formspec/core, @formspec/build, and @formspec/runtime
  - Added ESM requirements section to all package READMEs
  - Updated package.json files to include README.md in published packages

  This addresses DX evaluation feedback that published packages lacked documentation,
  making it difficult for new users to get started.

- [#17](https://github.com/mike-north/formspec/pull/17) [`96f08ac`](https://github.com/mike-north/formspec/commit/96f08acc744ca1de8f8ca58be15e51844aba29e9) Thanks [@mike-north](https://github.com/mike-north)! - Fix TypeScript type resolution by including API Extractor in build

  Previously, the `types` field in package.json pointed to rolled-up declaration
  files (e.g., `./dist/dsl.d.ts`), but these files were not being generated
  during the build because API Extractor was not included in the build script.

  This caused TypeScript users to see:

  ```
  error TS2307: Cannot find module '@formspec/dsl' or its corresponding type declarations.
  ```

  The fix adds `api-extractor run --local` to the build scripts for all affected
  packages, ensuring the declaration rollup files are generated during every build.
